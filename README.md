I have developed a personal website as a platform to support my resume.
The user or visitor will navigate on a mobile responsive and user-friendly website showcasing the various projects I have worked on.
The home page of my portfolio website presents a series of CSS animations and a menu bar designed to enhance the user experience.
It contains a home, about, projects, and contact page all accessible from the menu bar.
It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.
